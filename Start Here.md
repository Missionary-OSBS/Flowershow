## Forewords
For the rest of this tutorial, I will use terms
- "note" to refer a markdown file inside this folder / vault named "Tutorial"
- [[#Hotkeys]]: ‚åò ‚å• ‚åÉ will be used instead of Windows Alt Ctrl  respectively

## Welcome to my tutorial
Thank you for spending time to investigate my Tutorial vault. I hope you learn something good from this one. 


I highly recommend that you practice and get familiarized with [[Markdown Syntax]] first. I'd already prepared for you the workspace "Practice Markdown Syntax". There are 2 ways to open the workspace:
1. You can use [[#Hotkeys]] `‚åò ‚å• ‚åÉ W` > Load "Practice Markdown Syntax"
2. You can manually open *Command Palette* `‚åò P` > `Workspaces: Manage workspace layouts` > Load "Practice Markdown Syntax"

With this workspace, you can see all [[Markdown Syntax]] basics from the left pane while practicing in the right pane.

## Modes of using
![](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/f786db9fac45774fa4f0d8112e232d67/Attachments/Editor%20update%20chart.png)
There are 3 basic modes in New Editor:
- **Source mode** (behind-the-scene) use this mode when you want to closely examine and quickly edit markdown syntax
- **Live Preview mode** (all-the-time recommended) only when you move your cursor to formatted texts or codes, you can see the markdown syntax. <u>E.g.</u> try moving the cursor to **this** and you will see `**this**`
- **Reading view** (enjoy reading without editing) use this mode when you want to read only

>[!note]+ How do I know which mode I'm in ?
>- When you see book icon ![[Interface-book-icon.jpg|30]], you're in **Editing view** (Source mode / Live Preview mode)
>- When you see pencil icon ![[Interface-pencil-icon.jpg|30]], you're in **Reading view**
>- The philosophy is that when you click ![[Interface-book-icon.jpg|30]], you switch to **Reading view**
> 

> **My thoughts**: When I first used Obsidian, I hated switching back and forth between *Edit mode* and *Preview mode* using [[#Hotkeys]] `‚åò E`. "Why can't I simply type and move on with life ?" I thought. *Edit mode* (Source mode) looks like I'm coding and writing a piece of software. It may be cool or may be a mess to look at. Plus, Obsidian at that time was still in development and poorly designed. After uninstalling Obsidian and a long few months, I decided to re-install Obsidian and officially started using it since. Now, we have **Live Preview** that can make life easier, so you don't have to switch between **Source mode** and **Read mode**.

## Hotkeys 
| Mac Key     | Window Key                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| ‚åò (command) | ![[Windows.jpg]] (windows) |
| ‚å• (option)  | Alt                        |
| ‚åÉ (control) | Ctrl                       |
[More Basic Hotkeys](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Editing+shortcuts)

>[!note]+ How to find Hotkey setting
> - Go to Settings (`‚åò ,` in MacOS / `Ctrl ,` in Window) > In Options section: Hotkeys

>[!note]+ How to edit Hotkey
> - Click on `+` and type the hotkey combination you want for that command. If the hotkeys are already assigned to a command, it will turn red. 
> - `blank` = no hotkey assigned to that command
> - `üîÑ` (restore default) = clear all hotkeys assigned to that command back to default setting
> - `X` = remove the hotkey assigned to that command
> - A command can be assigned with more than 1 Hotkey

>[!note]+ How to search Hotkey
> There are 3 ways to search
> 1. Search by text from textfield: type in the command name
> 2. Search by hotkey from keyboard icon: type in the hotkeys 
> 3. Search by filter using filter icon: All (default), Assigned, Assigned by me, Unassigned

## Interface
![[Interface#^group=BdYzPksIjI_QO2DGHoNNP|1000]]
This is the embedded image from [[Interface]] `v.1.6.4`. This interface may be different, depending on Obsidian version you're using. 

Let's familiarize yourself with Obsidian interface.

## Markdown Syntax
[[Markdown Syntax]]

## Author's Note
Not every system is perfect. Not every system can work for everyone. My advice is to take whatever methods or workflows from this tutorial that work for you, to enhance your own system. 

There is a lot more that I have not covered yet. I believe this vault will prepare you with all the basics needed for your journey to second brain system. No time wasted to figure it out on your own. Start doing what matters to you, and start small. It takes time to build up. Any system needs to be used and maintained or it will become irreverent and outdated.

### My use cases
- **Writing Journal** 
- **Writing Lyrics**
- **Learning notes**
- **My Collection List** I call it "The List" of everything, from collection of books, apps, plug-ins, meetings, emails, ...
- **RPG Campaigns**
- **Article collector**
- **Password Manager**
- **Film / TV series summaries** 

There are a lot that you can do with your second brain system (Personal Knowledge Management / Personal Wikipedia). In my use cases, I use it for writing journal/diary, novels, essays, collections of any kind (books, articles, personal items), password manager (I rather take note of my passwords manually cause I don't trust in Safari password manager; sometimes it forgets to save my passwords), memoir to remember important info, and much more. Some people use it for keeping track of their health/mood/finance, to-do list, RPG game campaigns,
